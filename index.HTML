<pre id="q1">Welcome to my first ever website project.It is quite simple but full of positive reminders that this life is indeed amazing.I am 34 years old with a beutiful son and an amazing husband.
I love the beach so much and my dream vacation is to go to Maldives someday.I balance my life between my night job,
school, house chores and motherhood.It is challenging but surely rewarding.My stress relievers are the following: baking, going to the beach, visit to the spa or a little bit of shopping.
I am so grateful I was given this opportunity to venture into programming as I consider myself a non-techy person. I am hoping to pass this subject. Thank you and Godspeed!
